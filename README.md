# Mapping_Earthquakes



## Overview

For this analysis, we examined earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey.  Data was then visualized on an HTML site using javascript, the javascript D3 library, and mapbox to create a map of earthquakes that have occurred in recent time. 

The map uses three layers diplaying all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plate lines with the ability for a user to toggle the layers on and off the map. Also included were three different types of maps that can be selected according to the user's preference.  The generated maps are powered by mapbox. Each datapoint for an earthquake is represented by a circle marker colored and sized to indicate the size of the event in question. Lines indicating tectonic plates are also included and denoted by a blue line to illustrate the tendency of the events to coalesce around these plates.
